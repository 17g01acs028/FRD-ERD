# Introduction

This repository contains my documentation for both the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and the Functional Requirements Document (FRD). These documents serve as a guide for a security system dedicated to monitoring the entry and exit of visitors to a building. Alongside tracking visitor movement, this system also administers the overall management of the building infrastructure.

**Please note**: _The flowchart diagram that provides a detailed account of all processes in the ERD is currently in progress and will be completed shortly._
