Introduction
This repository contains my documents for both the ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) and the FRD (Functional Requirements Document). These documents are designed as a guide for a security system that tracks the entry and exit of visitors in and out of a building. Additionally, the system manages the building as a whole.

Please note: The flowchart diagram detailing all processes in the ERD is still under development and will be completed shortly.
